# Blackjack (C++)
This projected was developed to learn how to program in C++. I have not yet finished writing the entire game flow but it was
a good start to learn the basics/syntax of C++.

## Compiling and Executing the Project
On Windows, open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory. Run `g++ *.src && a.exe`.
